# College Project: Personal Dashboard

This project was developed during my time in college as a convenient tool to provide various information for residents and visitors of Berkeley. The Personal Dashboard is a web application that integrates several features including restaurant recommendations, weather information, local news updates, local Reddit posts, and a todo list. The aim of this project was to simplify the process of finding relevant information and enhancing the user's experience.
